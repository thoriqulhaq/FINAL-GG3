# TOKOPEDIA PLAY CLONE

  

The objective for the mid-term project within Generasi Gigih 3.0 is to craft an interactive live shopping platform. This platform's primary purpose is to facilitate user engagement during live shopping events, providing them with opportunities to explore diverse product offerings and actively participate by sharing comments throughout the live sessions.
